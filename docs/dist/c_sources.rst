Lazy reST pregenerated C sources
================================

Thank you for trying the C sources package of `Lazy reST
<https://github.com/gradha/lazy_rest>`_!

This package contains the pre generated C sources for some platforms and CPU
types and the pre generated HTML documentation inside the ``documentation``
directory (you can read this online at http://gradha.github.io/lazy_rest/). If
you need a different platform/CPU type you can compile it yourself from the
Nimrod source, or request it at https://github.com/gradha/lazy_rest/issues.
Good luck!
