Lazy reST badger quick readme
=============================

Thank you for trying the binary package of `Lazy reST
<https://github.com/gradha/lazy_rest>`_!

This binary package contains only this brief welcome, the `usage manual
<lazy_rest_badger_usage.html>`_ (`see online
<http://gradha.github.io/lazy_rest/gh_docs/master/docs/lazy_rest_badger_usage.html>`_)
and the binary itself. The ``lazy_rest_bager.exe`` is a statically compiled
binary which should work on your platform without further dependencies. There
is no explicit installation, you can simply run the program and it should work.
If you like it you can of course put it somewhere in your ``$PATH`` or create a
shortcut/alias to it so that you don't have to type too much to run it.

If something doesn't work, you can drop me a note at
https://github.com/gradha/lazy_rest/issues. Good luck!
