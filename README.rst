Lazy reST
=========

Lazy reST is a `Nimrod <http://nimrod-lang.org>`_ module providing a slightly
higher level API over `Nimrod's rstgen module
<http://nimrod-lang.org/rstgen.html>`_. The actual rstgen module and friends
are duplicated here, which allows to use the stable Nimrod compiler version
with the latest features. Additional features may be provided in the future.
