Unfinished markdown block
=========================

The rst parser supports the triple quote block when the ``roSupportMarkdown``
option is used in the parser.

```
But what happens when we don't finish one?

End of document. Note this rst file is artificially modified to end without a
newline to trigger the EOF markdown failure.
