Absolute windows include
========================

This file includes an absolute path to a typical Windows file. It might appear,
or it might fail. Let's seeâ€¦

.. include:: C:\boot.ini
    :literal:

What this means is that absolute paths are dangerous and if you are writing a
web server generating HTML from rst you need to sanitize include paths with a
custom file handler.
